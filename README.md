A PROSPECTIVE-GLASS FOR SAINTS AND SINNERS. Whereby may appear and be seen,
1. The Authors Life expr
1. AN EPISTLE IN GENERAL.

1. AN EPISTLE WRITTEN To the Believers of the Witnesses of the SPIRIT.

1. The Contents of this Book.

#####Body#####

1. CHAP. I. What manner of lives the Saints ought to live in this World.

1. CHAP. II. How hard a matter it is to please the Devil; and what those are to believe that expect comfort by believing; and what Saints are to strive about.

1. CHAP. III. What an Enemy the Riches of this world is to Truth. And how all things are possible for God to do, which his
Glory moveth him to do. And how the Worlds Riches is of the nature of a Loadstone.

1. CHAP. IV. How careful people ought to be, in preserving that which they labour for, because Poverty is a great Enemy to Truth, and breaketh the peace of the mind.

1. CHAP. V. How people ought to be moderate in all things: The comfort of Moderation, and the discomfort of Immoderation, Excess and Extravagancie.

1. CHAP. VI. Every true Believer is Heir to the Kingdom of Heaven, because he is free-born, and free by Redemption.

1. CHAP. VII. When any evil is committed by a Believer, it stoppeth the current of his Faith: Yet it is the heart that God mindeth,
and not the outward appearance. That every Believer should weed his own Garden.

1. CHAP. VIII. He is not accounted a wise man that will wilfully wound himself. How we may know when our sins are forgiven.

1. CHAP. IX. How Eternity became Time: and the Eternal Father became a Son, born of a Virgin. Now is the Prophesie of Isaiah fulfilled.

1. CHAP. X. How the Believers of the Witnesses of the Spirit have a threefold Knowledge; and the Witnesses of the Spirit, are the third and last Witnesses that God will send on this Earth, to declare his mind unto the World.

1. CHAP. XI. Where the Truth and true Knowledge, Peace, and Satisfaction is to be had: And how it keepeth us from going a whoring after strange Gods.

1. CHAP. XII. How all sober men are to labour to know what they believe, that they may lay hold on the good Word of Prophesie; and not be fed up with Fancies to believe in that which no man can discribe what it is, or where it is.

1. CHAP. XIII. In Christ is comprehended the whole Trinity: no man on this earth can prove three Persons in the Trinity.

1. CHAP. XIV. God is not in this world at all, but at such times as his Glory moveth him, to come down for a time: neither doth God dwell in this world any other way, but in the hearts of his Saints by Faith. There is no Salvation for those that refuse Christ to be their God.

1. CHAP. XV. The Soul of Man is Generated with its Body, therefore it liveth and dieth with the Body, and is never parted from it.

1. CHAP. XVI. There are several Degrees of Knowledge, but no degree able to give true Rest to the mind, until a man can believe the true Messengers of God.

1. CHAP. XVII. Truth is a Pearl of great price, therefore a man must part with all to purchase it; And those only that hold out in their Faith to their lives end shall be saved; but for those that fall back, and withdraw their love from it, for them there is no Redemption.

1. CHAP. XVIII. How all the Seed of Faith may be made able to say with me, and all true Believers, That they can read that new Name written in themselves, and what the hidden Manna is.
